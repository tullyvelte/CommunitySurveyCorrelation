					<p>It's easy to overlook what one assumes is an everyday thing. While the internet is pervasive throughout modern life, some folks in every state somehow manage to not go online for extendeded periods of time. A surprising number haven't been online in over 30 days. </p>
					<p>A susbstantial part of the population also didn't work over the entire 12 months of 2014. There can be many reasons why, which are not explored here. It is notable though that the correlation with this population, and those that haven't used the internet is strong.</p>
					<p>Whatever conclusions one jumps to, it's pretty clear that working and even moderate internet use are increasingly inseparable</p>
					<h5>Assumptions to Explore/Unassume</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>Not working means you're looking for work</li>
							<li>Job Seeking needs to be internet-based</li>
							<li>If you're working, you will be going online</li>
							<li>Are there jobs that don't require or make use of going online?</li>
							<li>Who is not working and not online?</li>
							<li>Are the demographics the same state to state, region to region?</li>			
						</ul>
					<p>What at first seemed like an obvious probable correlation, did show that even so, there is a lot left to be explored. The raw numbers themselves could be a story maybe, but we're just strating to drill down.</p>
